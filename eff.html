        <h1>Effects</h1>
        <p><em>The primary and most direct effect of renewable resources is the positive impact on the environment. Unlike conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels, renewable resources generate electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the contribution to climate change. The use of solar, wind, hydro, and other renewables helps decrease air pollution, limit deforestation, and preserve biodiversity, contributing to overall ecosystem health.

        
            One of the most significant effects of renewable resources is their role in mitigating climate change. By displacing fossil fuels, which release large amounts of carbon dioxide when burned, renewables contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</div>
